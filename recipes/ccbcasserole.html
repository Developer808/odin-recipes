            <li>2 cups chopped cooked chicken breast</li>
            <li>8 ounces cooked ham, cubed</li>
            <li>8 ounces Swiss cheese, cubed</li>
            <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can reduced-fat, reduced-sodium cream of chicken soup (such as Campbell's® Healthy Request)</li>
            <li>½ cup 2% milk</li>
            <li>½ cup light sour cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>⅓ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese  </li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and transfer noodles to the prepared casserole dish; top with chicken, ham, and Swiss cheese.</li>
            <li>Mix cream of chicken soup, milk, and sour cream together in a bowl; spoon soup mixture over noodle mixture.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in the melted butter until crumbs are coated with butter and cheese, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture over casserole.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Allow casserole to cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li> 
        </ol>
